Executables for work done in-class and for assignments

I started at the Lethbridge College in the fall semester of 2016 and these are some brief examples. Since then I have been working to expand my knowledge
about different languages and platforms. I am always interested in learning more.

These are some of the languages I have learned during my time at the Lethbridge College.

Fall 2016 - C++, HTML and CSS, Javascript
Winter 2017 - Java, C#, SQL
Fall 2017 - PHP, AJAX
